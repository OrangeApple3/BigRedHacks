DESCRIPTION:

2d game coded from scratch in Python using PyGame. All backgrounds, character models, and art designs created using Sketch and Adobe Illustrator.

We imagined a game in which you would be fighting your way through enemies to protect an endangered animal at the end. 

We hope to improve the character design later on, add more gameplay mechanics, and lastly, a wider variety of endangered species and ways to save them. 


COMMANDS: 

Arrows Keys to Move, Space to Shoot.


BUILD:

Install PyGame 1.9.2a0 and Python 2.7

unzip BigRedHacks and navigate to BigRedHacks directory from command line 

run python game.py from command line 

Enjoy! :)
